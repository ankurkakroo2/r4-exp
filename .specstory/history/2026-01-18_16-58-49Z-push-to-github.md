The user wants to push their changes to GitHub. Let me check the current git status to see what needs to be committed and pushed.

From the gitStatus provided at the start of the conversation:
- Current branch: main
- Modified files:
  - .specstory/.project.json
  - .specstory/history/2026-01-18_14-37-29Z-i-have-this-kit.md
- Untracked files:
  - .specstory/history/2026-01-18_16-58-00Z-command-name-install-slack.md
  - .specstory/history/2026-01-18_16-58-30Z-push-to-github.md

I need to:
1. Add all the files
2. Create a commit with a meaningful message
3. Push to the remote repository

Let me first check the status to see what we're working with, then add, commit, and push.

Good, I can see:
1. There are 2 modified files in the .specstory directory
2. There are 3 untracked files (seems like a new one was created during this conversation)
3. The remote is set to https://github.com/ankurkakroo2/r4-exp.git

Now I'll add all these files, commit them with an appropriate message, and push to GitHub.
